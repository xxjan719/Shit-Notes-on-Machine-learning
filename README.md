Writer by xxjan719

This notes may be my first learning note in deep learning.Although I am also a new explorer in this field,but I want to try it hard to understand this popular and restate it into this README.md.At the same times I  use  the books called Deep learning which is written by **Zhihua Zhou** and courses by bilibili.If you want to contect me,please follow this [page]("http://xxjan719@github.io")
