# Deep Learning Studying Notes (Personality)
@[XXJAN](https://github.com/xxjan719/)

This notes may be my first learning note in deep learning.Although I am also a new explorer in this field,but I want to try it hard to understand this popular and restate it into this README.md.At the same times I  use  the books called Deep learning which is written by **Zhihua Zhou** and courses by bilibili.If you want to contect me,please follow this [page](https://xxjan719@github.io)


**Cost Function**<br>
It is called the cost function if a funtion satisfies the difference the real value <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?y" /> between every evaluated value <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h(\theta)" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?h(\theta)" /> which can measure the model.And it is denoted by <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?C(\theta)" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?C(\theta)" />.If  more samples exists, values on the cost function can be substituted to the mean value,denoted by <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?J(\theta)" title="http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?J(\theta)" />.And it is easy to get the properites of the  cost function. <br>
